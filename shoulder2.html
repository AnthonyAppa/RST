      <p>Make sure to do each of these exercises for around 8-12 repetitions and to have control over the weight. To control the weight make sure you are able to control the weight on the way down, and really feel your muscle contracting. It is important to start with lighter weight as it is important not to get injured. However, it is important that you try and add a little bit of weight each time in order to reach progressive overload and become stornger over time.</p>
